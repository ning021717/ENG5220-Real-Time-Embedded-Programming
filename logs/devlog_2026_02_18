Project: Sign Language Translator Glasses — Embedded Real-Time CV System

---

## Summary
Today marks a major milestone in the project: a fully functional closed-loop computer vision system has been successfully implemented and validated on Raspberry Pi.

The system now supports real-time gesture recognition combined with automated speech feedback, demonstrating a complete perception → inference → interaction pipeline.

Current Status:
End-to-end system operational and stable.

## Completed System Architecture

The system consists of four integrated modules:

---

### 1. Visual Perception Layer
The Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 (IMX219) is used to capture real-time image frames. OpenCV handles frame acquisition, preprocessing, and pipeline control.

Key achievements:
- Stable real-time image acquisition confirmed
- Frame stream verified through runtime monitoring
- Camera driver stack validated and stabilized
- Continuous frame pipeline achieved without blocking

Engineering decision:
CSI camera with libcamera backend was selected over USB camera due to lower latency, reduced CPU overhead, and higher driver stability.

---

### 2. Core Recognition Algorithm
A lightweight real-time recognition pipeline was implemented using classical computer vision methods.

Processing pipeline:
Frame → HSV conversion → Skin detection → ROI extraction → Feature vector → KNN classification

Design rationale:
HSV color space improves robustness against lighting variation.
KNN classifier chosen because it provides:
- fast inference
- low computational cost
- minimal training requirement
- suitability for embedded deployment

### 3. Dataset Engineering Module
A dedicated dataset collection tool was developed to generate custom gesture training data.

Dataset characteristics:
- Gesture classes: A, B, C
- Controlled capture environment
- Consistent resolution and preprocessing
- Structured binary storage format

Engineering advantages:
- Perfect alignment between training and runtime features
- Eliminates domain mismatch
- Faster loading compared to image datasets

---

### 4. Interactive Output Layer
A real-time speech feedback module was integrated using a Text-to-Speech engine.

Output pipeline:
Predicted gesture → text label → TTS engine → spoken output

Validation results:
Speech output successfully triggered after recognition.
Audio playback latency within acceptable real-time interaction limits.
System demonstrates closed-loop human–machine interaction.
