**Project:** Sign Language Translator Glasses (Real-time Recognition on Raspberry Pi)

---

## 📝 Summary
Today’s focus was on stabilizing the **Raspberry Pi Camera Module v2 (IMX219)** and establishing a reliable real-time frame acquisition loop. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Current Status:** Hardware-level image acquisition is fully functional. However, the recognition module is integrated but **unvalidated**, and the system currently does not produce text or letter outputs.

---

## ✅ Completed Work

### 1. Camera Pipeline & Hardware
* **Hardware Verified:** Confirmed camera functionality using `rpicam-still`. Still image capture is successful.
* **Resource Management:** Resolved device contention issues where background services (e.g., `viam-csi`) were occupying `/dev/media0`.
* **Driver Stack:** Validated `libcamera` and GStreamer functionality with the following test pipeline:
    ```bash
    gst-launch-1.0 libcamerasrc ! video/x-raw,format=NV12,width=640,height=480 ! fakesink
    ```

### 2. Real-time Architecture
* **Threaded Capture:** Implemented a non-blocking threaded loop to handle continuous frame acquisition.
* **Instrumentation:** Added a frame counter to monitor real-time throughput. Logs confirm that frames are being successfully pulled into the buffer.
* **Cleanup Logic:** Ensured proper release of camera resources to prevent "Device Busy" errors on script restart.

## ⚠️ Issues & Findings (Debugging Status)

| Component | Status | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Camera** | 🟢 Functional | Can take photos and stream frames. |
| **Recognition** | 🟡 Unvalidated | Code is present but logic has not been tested against live input. |
| **Letter Output**| 🔴 Non-functional | No alphabet labels are being printed or logged yet. |

* **Feature Mismatch:** The recognition module expects a feature vector of **1890 floats** (30 frames × 63 features). There is likely a mismatch between the live extractor and the pre-saved `.bin` templates.
* **OpenCV Backend:** Standard `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` via V4L2 is inconsistent with the new libcamera stack; switching to GStreamer `appsink` is required for stability.

## 📅 Next Steps
1.  **Validate Inference:** Test the feature extraction logic to ensure the output dimensions match the gesture templates.
2.  **Enable Console Output:** Debug the print logic to ensure recognized letters (A, B, C, etc.) appear in the terminal.
3.  **Refine Preprocessing:** Align real-time frame sampling with the original template generation parameters.
4.  **Performance Metrics:** Once recognition is functional, measure the latency from "Hand Gesture" to "Letter Display."
